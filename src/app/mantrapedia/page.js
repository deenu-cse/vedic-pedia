Rama means all pervading. Vedas donâ€™t refer to Maryada Purushotam Shri Ram Chandra ji, the king of Ayodhya. Shri Ram Chandra ji studied Vedas in their gurukul life. The period of Shri Ram Chandra ji, undoubtedly was Treta yuga, the second age, whereas Vedas were given to the rishis just after the human creation i.e. the beginning of Satayuga, the first age.
